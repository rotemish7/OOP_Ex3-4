# OOP_Ex3-4

This project is a game we build during a study for OOP class in Ariel University.
The aim of the game is to get as much points as you can get in the time given.

There are two types of fruits: Apple and Banana.

The game has 24 levels form 0 to 23, it also has two type mode: auto or manual.

In auto mode the robots will move according to the algorithm we wrote
whethere in manual mode the user himself will determine the robots movement.

each level has its own amount of robots and fruits.
Fruits are recreated automaticly by the server when the robots eats them.

After the game is ended you can choose to save the game info to  KML file.
which later can be opened in google earth app, there you can see the robots and fruits trace 
and the graph of the game.

* Log of all the games the user played.
* The highest level the user achieved.
* The best score of each level.
* The user placement in all of the database.
